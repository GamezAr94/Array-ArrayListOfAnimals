# ArrayOfAnimals
This Console application creates two collections of objects: the first uses the System.Array class (a simple array), and the second uses the System.Collections.ArrayList class. Both collections are of Animal objects.

# What I Learned 
* Get instances derived from an abstract class using Polymorphism and Casting.
* Implement and use the *System.Collections.ArrayList* class.
