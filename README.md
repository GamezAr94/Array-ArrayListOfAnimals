# Array&ArrayListOfAnimals
This Console application creates two collections of objects: the first uses the System.Array class (a simple array), and the second uses the System.Collections.ArrayList class. Both collections are of Animal objects.

The codein the second Branch implement a strongly typed collection of Animal objects in a class called Animals. The code in Main() simply instantiates an Animals object called animalCollection, adds two items (an instance of Cow and Chicken), and uses a foreach loop to call the Feed() method that both objects inherit from their base class, Animal.

# What I Learned 
* Get instances derived from an abstract class using Polymorphism and Casting.
* Implement and use the *System.Collections.ArrayList* class.
* Create Strongly typed collection.
* Add Indexers to a class to provide array-like access.
